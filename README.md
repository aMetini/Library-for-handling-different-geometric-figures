# Library-for-handling-different-geometric-figurs

Application utilizes polymorphism of different classes that inherit from other classes in order to randomly generate different geometric figures and their dimensions. 

The application creates a list of 20 random shapes by calling a method called GenerateShape().  The program then loops through the list and print out all the shapes to 
the console.  Additionally, it calculates out the sum of the perimeter of all triangle shapes that were generated in the list.  Moreover, the program finds the largest 
(by volume) three-dimensional shape in the list.
